# **S – Situation**

The Data Analyst job market dataset was messy, incomplete, and inconsistent, making it hard to extract meaningful insights about salaries, company behavior, ratings, and job availability.
To understand hiring patterns and the overall job landscape, the dataset first needed proper cleaning and then a thorough visual exploration.

# **T – Task**

My objective was to:

Clean and standardize the dataset by addressing missing values and inconsistent columns

Explore key attributes using Python

Visualize salary patterns, company characteristics, ratings, and job distributions

Extract insights that reveal what drives higher salaries, which companies pay best, and how job quality varies across organizations

# **A – Action**
**1. Data Cleaning & Preparation**

Inspected missing values and rows with nulls

Removed non-essential columns to streamline analysis

Standardized column names and formats

Ensured numerical fields (salaries, ratings) were properly typed

Produced a fully cleaned dataset ready for analysis

**2. Exploratory Analysis & Visualization**

Built targeted visualizations to uncover patterns in the Data Analyst job market:

***Salary Insights***

Strong positive correlation between experience level and average salary
→ Senior & Expert roles dominated the top-paying brackets

Certain job categories consistently commanded higher pay (e.g., analytics engineering, data science–aligned roles)

***Company Insights***

Identified the top-paying companies for Data Analyst roles

Companies with higher employee ratings tended to offer better salaries

Ownership type played a role:

Public companies and large private firms offered the most competitive packages

Small or newly formed companies offered lower but more variable pay

***Job Rating Distribution***

Most companies fell into the mid-rating bracket, showing moderate employee satisfaction

High-paying companies generally had better ratings, suggesting stronger work cultures

***Job Availability & Ownership***

Certain ownership types (public, enterprise-level private) had significantly higher job postings

Non-profit and small private companies showed limited opportunities but wider salary ranges

# **R – Result**

This project delivered a clean dataset and a clear, data-backed understanding of the Data Analyst job market:

Revealed which experience levels and job categories drive higher salaries

Highlighted the companies and ownership types offering the most attractive roles

Provided a breakdown of how company ratings correlate with job quality

Mapped the overall job landscape in terms of demand, pay, and organization type

Overall, this project demonstrates my ability to handle data cleaning, EDA, visualization, and extract meaningful insights for career and business decisions in the Data Analyst job market.
